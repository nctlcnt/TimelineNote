# Building a new project for fun

Not sure what this will be...

But I'm enjoying building it


**Used in this project**: Typescript, React, date-fns, material-ui, and more

## Notes
> Adding `craco` and `tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin` to the project to allow alias imports. - Reference: [ts-monorepo](https://github.com/NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo#create-react-app)
